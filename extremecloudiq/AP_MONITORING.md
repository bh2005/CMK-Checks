# Based on the ExtremeCloud IQ (XIQ) API documentation, there are several key metrics and endpoints that can be used to monitor Access Points (APs) effectively. Below are some suggestions for monitoring APs, along with the relevant API endpoints and metrics:

## 1. AP Health and Status
Monitoring the health and status of APs is critical to ensure they are operational and performing well.

### Endpoints:
GET /devices: Retrieve a list of all devices, including APs.

Filter by device_type to get only APs.

Example: device_type=AP.

### Metrics to Monitor:
Status: Check if the AP is online or offline.

Uptime: Measure how long the AP has been operational.

Last Seen: Timestamp of the last communication with the AP.

Example API Call:
```python
devices = get_xiq_data("/devices", api_key, params={"device_type": "AP"})
for device in devices.get("data", []):
    print(f"AP Name: {device['name']}, Status: {device['status']}, Uptime: {device['system_up_time']}")
```
## 2. AP Performance Metrics
Monitoring performance metrics helps identify bottlenecks and optimize network performance.

Endpoints:
GET /devices/{id}/performance: Retrieve performance metrics for a specific AP.

GET /devices/{id}/clients: Retrieve connected clients for a specific AP.

Metrics to Monitor:
CPU Usage: High CPU usage may indicate overload.

Memory Usage: High memory usage may indicate resource exhaustion.

Throughput: Measure upload and download speeds.

Connected Clients: Number of clients connected to the AP.

Signal Strength: RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) for connected clients.

Example API Call:
```python
ap_id = 12345  # Replace with actual AP ID
performance = get_xiq_data(f"/devices/{ap_id}/performance", api_key)
clients = get_xiq_data(f"/devices/{ap_id}/clients", api_key)

print(f"CPU Usage: {performance['cpu_usage']}%")
print(f"Memory Usage: {performance['memory_usage']}%")
print(f"Connected Clients: {len(clients['data'])}")
```

## 3. AP Configuration and Firmware
Ensuring APs are properly configured and running the latest firmware is essential for security and performance.

Endpoints:
GET /devices/{id}/configuration: Retrieve configuration details for a specific AP.

GET /devices/{id}/firmware: Retrieve firmware details for a specific AP.

Metrics to Monitor:
Firmware Version: Ensure APs are running the latest firmware.

Configuration Compliance: Verify that APs are configured according to organizational policies.

Example API Call:
```python
ap_id = 12345  # Replace with actual AP ID
configuration = get_xiq_data(f"/devices/{ap_id}/configuration", api_key)
firmware = get_xiq_data(f"/devices/{ap_id}/firmware", api_key)

print(f"Firmware Version: {firmware['version']}")
print(f"Configuration: {configuration['config']}")
```

## 4. AP Radio and Channel Utilization
Monitoring radio and channel utilization helps optimize wireless network performance.

Endpoints:
GET /devices/{id}/radios: Retrieve radio details for a specific AP.

GET /devices/{id}/channels: Retrieve channel utilization for a specific AP.

Metrics to Monitor:
Radio Status: Ensure radios are enabled and functioning.

Channel Utilization: Measure how busy each channel is.

Interference: Detect interference from other devices or networks.

Example API Call:
```python
ap_id = 12345  # Replace with actual AP ID
radios = get_xiq_data(f"/devices/{ap_id}/radios", api_key)
channels = get_xiq_data(f"/devices/{ap_id}/channels", api_key)

for radio in radios['data']:
    print(f"Radio {radio['radio_id']} Status: {radio['status']}")
for channel in channels['data']:
    print(f"Channel {channel['channel']} Utilization: {channel['utilization']}%")
```
    
## 5. AP Alarms and Events
Monitoring alarms and events helps identify and resolve issues proactively.

Endpoints:
GET /alarms: Retrieve alarms for all devices.

GET /events: Retrieve events for all devices.

Metrics to Monitor:
Alarm Severity: Critical, major, minor, or warning alarms.

Event Types: Connectivity issues, configuration changes, etc.

Example API Call:
```python
alarms = get_xiq_data("/alarms", api_key)
events = get_xiq_data("/events", api_key)

for alarm in alarms['data']:
    print(f"Alarm: {alarm['description']}, Severity: {alarm['severity']}")
for event in events['data']:
    print(f"Event: {event['description']}, Type: {event['type']}")
```

## 6. AP Location and Topology
Understanding the physical location and network topology of APs helps with troubleshooting and optimization.

Endpoints:
GET /devices/{id}/location: Retrieve location details for a specific AP.

GET /devices/{id}/topology: Retrieve network topology for a specific AP.

Metrics to Monitor:
Location: Physical location of the AP (e.g., building, floor, room).

Topology: Network connections and relationships with other devices.

Example API Call:
```python
ap_id = 12345  # Replace with actual AP ID
location = get_xiq_data(f"/devices/{ap_id}/location", api_key)
topology = get_xiq_data(f"/devices/{ap_id}/topology", api_key)

print(f"Location: {location['building']}, Floor: {location['floor']}, Room: {location['room']}")
print(f"Topology: {topology['connections']}")
```

## Implementation in Checkmk
To integrate these metrics into Checkmk:

### Create Custom Checks:

Use the script to fetch data from the XIQ API.

Output the data in Checkmk's agent format (e.g., <<<section>>>).

### Define Service Discovery Rules:

Use Checkmk's WATO to define rules for discovering APs and their metrics.

### Set Up Dashboards:

Create dashboards in Checkmk to visualize AP health, performance, and alarms.

Example Checkmk Output
plaintext
```
<<<xiq_ap_health>>>
AP1 Online 30d 12h 34m
AP2 Offline 0d 0h 0m

<<<xiq_ap_performance>>>
AP1 CPU 20% Memory 50% Clients 15
AP2 CPU 80% Memory 90% Clients 50

<<<xiq_ap_alarms>>>
AP1 Critical High CPU Usage
AP2 Warning Firmware Update Required
```
Summary
By leveraging the XIQ API, you can monitor a wide range of metrics for Access Points, including health, performance, configuration, and alarms. Integrating these metrics into Checkmk will provide comprehensive visibility into your wireless network and help you proactively address issues.
